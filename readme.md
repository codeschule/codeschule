## What is CodeSchule

"CodeSchule" is for children between 4 to 9 years of age and will teach them the basics of programming. This repository contains material and information about CodeSchule.

CodeSchule is originally from Finland (by name [Koodikoulu](http://koodikoulu.fi/)). The original father of the idea and the principal of the 'Koodikoulu' is Juha Paananen ([@raimohanska](https://github.com/raimohanska)). We are greatful for him to open sourcing this idea and sharing the joy of programming to children all over the world!
